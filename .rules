## Rust Coding Guidelines

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
* Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
* Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
  - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
  - Use `.log_err()` or similar when you need to ignore errors but want visibility
  - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
  - Example: avoid `let _ = client.request(...).await?;` - use `client.request(...).await?;` instead
* When implementing async operations that may fail, ensure errors propagate to the UI layer so users get meaningful feedback.
* Never create files with `mod.rs` paths - prefer `src/some_module.rs` instead of `src/some_module/mod.rs`.
* When creating new crates, prefer specifying the library root path in `Cargo.toml` using `[lib] path = "...rs"` instead of the default `lib.rs`, to maintain consistent and descriptive naming (e.g., `gpui.rs` or `main.rs`).
* Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested
* Use full words for variable names (no abbreviations like "q" for "queue")
* Use variable shadowing to scope clones in async contexts for clarity, minimizing the lifetime of borrowed references.
  Example:
  ```rust
  executor.spawn({
      let task_ran = task_ran.clone();
      async move {
          *task_ran.borrow_mut() = true;
      }
  });
  ```

# Timers in tests

* In GPUI tests, prefer GPUI executor timers over `smol::Timer::after(...)` when you need timeouts, delays, or to drive `run_until_parked()`:
  - Use `cx.background_executor().timer(duration).await` (or `cx.background_executor.timer(duration).await` in `TestAppContext`) so the work is scheduled on GPUI's dispatcher.
  - Avoid `smol::Timer::after(...)` for test timeouts when you rely on `run_until_parked()`, because it may not be tracked by GPUI's scheduler and can lead to "nothing left to run" when pumping.

# GPUI

GPUI is a UI framework which also provides primitives for state and concurrency management.

## Context

Context types allow interaction with global state, windows, entities, and system services. They are typically passed to functions as the argument named `cx`. When a function takes callbacks they come after the `cx` parameter.

* `App` is the root context type, providing access to global state and read and update of entities.
* `Context<T>` is provided when updating an `Entity<T>`. This context dereferences into `App`, so functions which take `&App` can also take `&Context<T>`.
* `AsyncApp` and `AsyncWindowContext` are provided by `cx.spawn` and `cx.spawn_in`. These can be held across await points.

## `Window`

`Window` provides access to the state of an application window. It is passed to functions as an argument named `window` and comes before `cx` when present. It is used for managing focus, dispatching actions, directly drawing, getting user input state, etc.

## Entities

An `Entity<T>` is a handle to state of type `T`. With `thing: Entity<T>`:

* `thing.entity_id()` returns `EntityId`
* `thing.downgrade()` returns `WeakEntity<T>`
* `thing.read(cx: &App)` returns `&T`.
* `thing.read_with(cx, |thing: &T, cx: &App| ...)` returns the closure's return value.
* `thing.update(cx, |thing: &mut T, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)` allows the closure to mutate the state, and provides a `Context<T>` for interacting with the entity. It returns the closure's return value.
* `thing.update_in(cx, |thing: &mut T, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)` takes a `AsyncWindowContext` or `VisualTestContext`. It's the same as `update` while also providing the `Window`.

Within the closures, the inner `cx` provided to the closure must be used instead of the outer `cx` to avoid issues with multiple borrows.

Trying to update an entity while it's already being updated must be avoided as this will cause a panic.

When  `read_with`, `update`, or `update_in` are used with an async context, the closure's return value is wrapped in an `anyhow::Result`.

`WeakEntity<T>` is a weak handle. It has `read_with`, `update`, and `update_in` methods that work the same, but always return an `anyhow::Result` so that they can fail if the entity no longer exists. This can be useful to avoid memory leaks - if entities have mutually recursive handles to each other they will never be dropped.

## Concurrency

All use of entities and UI rendering occurs on a single foreground thread.

`cx.spawn(async move |cx| ...)` runs an async closure on the foreground thread. Within the closure, `cx` is `&mut AsyncApp`.

When the outer cx is a `Context<T>`, the use of `spawn` instead looks like `cx.spawn(async move |this, cx| ...)`, where `this: WeakEntity<T>` and `cx: &mut AsyncApp`.

To do work on other threads, `cx.background_spawn(async move { ... })` is used. Often this background task is awaited on by a foreground task which uses the results to update state.

Both `cx.spawn` and `cx.background_spawn` return a `Task<R>`, which is a future that can be awaited upon. If this task is dropped, then its work is cancelled. To prevent this one of the following must be done:

* Awaiting the task in some other async context.
* Detaching the task via `task.detach()` or `task.detach_and_log_err(cx)`, allowing it to run indefinitely.
* Storing the task in a field, if the work should be halted when the struct is dropped.

A task which doesn't do anything but provide a value can be created with `Task::ready(value)`.

## Elements

The `Render` trait is used to render some state into an element tree that is laid out using flexbox layout. An `Entity<T>` where `T` implements `Render` is sometimes called a "view".

Example:

```
struct TextWithBorder(SharedString);

impl Render for TextWithBorder {
    fn render(&mut self, _window: &mut Window, _cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {
        div().border_1().child(self.0.clone())
    }
}
```

Since `impl IntoElement for SharedString` exists, it can be used as an argument to `child`. `SharedString` is used to avoid copying strings, and is either an `&'static str` or `Arc<str>`.

UI components that are constructed just to be turned into elements can instead implement the `RenderOnce` trait, which is similar to `Render`, but its `render` method takes ownership of `self` and receives `&mut App` instead of `&mut Context<Self>`. Types that implement this trait can use `#[derive(IntoElement)]` to use them directly as children.

The style methods on elements are similar to those used by Tailwind CSS.

If some attributes or children of an element tree are conditional, `.when(condition, |this| ...)` can be used to run the closure only when `condition` is true. Similarly, `.when_some(option, |this, value| ...)` runs the closure when the `Option` has a value.

## Input events

Input event handlers can be registered on an element via methods like `.on_click(|event, window, cx: &mut App| ...)`.

Often event handlers will want to update the entity that's in the current `Context<T>`. The `cx.listener` method provides this - its use looks like `.on_click(cx.listener(|this: &mut T, event, window, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)`.

## Drag and Drop

**Pitfall:** `on_drag_move` fires for ALL registered handlers (Capture phase). Always check bounds:

```rust
.on_drag_move::<DraggedItem>(cx.listener(|this, event: &DragMoveEvent<DraggedItem>, _window, cx| {
    if event.bounds.contains(&event.event.position) {  // Required check!
        this.drag_target = Some(DragTarget::Root);
        cx.notify();
    }
}))
```

## Actions

Actions are dispatched via user keyboard interaction or in code via `window.dispatch_action(SomeAction.boxed_clone(), cx)` or `focus_handle.dispatch_action(&SomeAction, window, cx)`.

Actions with no data defined with the `actions!(some_namespace, [SomeAction, AnotherAction])` macro call. Otherwise the `Action` derive macro is used. Doc comments on actions are displayed to the user.

Action handlers can be registered on an element via the event handler `.on_action(|action, window, cx| ...)`. Like other event handlers, this is often used with `cx.listener`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts and Key Bindings

Keystroke format: `[ctrl-][alt-][shift-][cmd-]key` (e.g., `"ctrl-a"`, `"cmd-k left"` for multi-keystroke)

**Defining actions:**
```rust
actions!(editor, [MoveUp, MoveDown]);  // Simple actions
```

**Registering bindings and handlers:**
```rust
KeyBinding::new("cmd-z", UndoAction, Some("Editor"))  // With context predicate

div()
    .key_context("Editor")
    .on_action(cx.listener(Self::handle_undo))
    .on_key_down(cx.listener(|this, event, window, cx| { /* raw key */ }))
```

**Context predicates:** `"Editor"`, `"editor && vim_mode == normal"`, `"!(editor)"`, `"Workspace > Editor"`

**Event phases:** Capture (root→focused) then Bubble (focused→root). Use `cx.stop_propagation()` to halt.

**Tab handling:** Not automatic. Bind explicitly with `KeyBinding::new("tab", Tab, None)` and call `window.focus_next(cx)`.

## Notify

When a view's state has changed in a way that may affect its rendering, it should call `cx.notify()`. This will cause the view to be rerendered. It will also cause any observe callbacks registered for the entity with `cx.observe` to be called.

## Entity events

While updating an entity (`cx: Context<T>`), it can emit an event using `cx.emit(event)`. Entities register which events they can emit by declaring `impl EventEmitter<EventType> for EntityType {}`.

Other entities can then register a callback to handle these events by doing `cx.subscribe(other_entity, |this, other_entity, event, cx| ...)`. This will return a `Subscription` which deregisters the callback when dropped.  Typically `cx.subscribe` happens when creating a new entity and the subscriptions are stored in a `_subscriptions: Vec<Subscription>` field.

## Session Management

The terminal crate includes a session management system for persistent SSH/Telnet configurations (`crates/terminal/src/session_store.rs`).

### Data Model

- `SessionNode`: Enum representing either a `Group` or `Session` in a tree structure
- `SessionGroup`: Folder containing other groups or sessions
- `SessionConfig`: Session configuration with name, tags, and protocol-specific settings
- `ProtocolConfig`: Enum for `Ssh` or `Telnet` configurations
- `AuthMethod`: Authentication options (Interactive, Password, PrivateKey, Agent)

### GPUI Integration

- `SessionStoreEntity`: GPUI entity wrapping `SessionStore` with auto-save and event emission
- `GlobalSessionStore`: Global marker for `cx.global()` access
- `SessionStoreEvent`: Events for UI subscription (Changed, SessionAdded, SessionRemoved)

**Usage:** `SessionStoreEntity::init(cx)` on startup, then `SessionStoreEntity::global(cx)` to access. Subscribe to `SessionStoreEvent` for changes.

**Persistence:** `~/.config/bspterm/sessions.json`

## Telnet Connection

The terminal crate includes a Telnet connection module (`crates/terminal/src/connection/telnet/`) for connecting to remote hosts via the Telnet protocol.

### Module Structure

```
telnet/
  mod.rs          # TelnetConfig, exports
  protocol.rs     # Telnet IAC handling, option negotiation
  session.rs      # TelnetSession - TCP connection management
  terminal.rs     # TelnetTerminalConnection - implements TerminalConnection trait
```

### Protocol Implementation (`protocol.rs`)

- **IAC Commands**: IAC (255), DO (253), DONT (254), WILL (251), WONT (252), SB (250), SE (240)
- **Option Codes**: ECHO (1), SUPPRESS_GO_AHEAD (3), TERMINAL_TYPE (24), NAWS (31)
- `TelnetNegotiator`: Parses IAC sequences and generates appropriate responses
- `process_incoming()`: Separates terminal data from commands, returns protocol responses
- `build_naws()`: Generates window size subnegotiation packet (RFC 1073)
- IAC escaping: 255 255 → single 255

### Key Types

- `TelnetConfig`: Connection settings (host, port, username, password, encoding, terminal_type)
- `TelnetSession`: TCP connection lifecycle management
- `TelnetTerminalConnection`: Implements `TerminalConnection` trait (same interface as SSH)

**Usage:** `TerminalBuilder::new_with_telnet(config, ...)` or `connect_telnet(config, workspace, pane, window, cx)`

## Terminal Keybinding Interception

The terminal view intercepts keystrokes to decide whether they should be sent to the shell or handled by Bspterm's action system (`crates/terminal_view/src/terminal_view.rs`).

### Behavior

When `send_keybindings_to_shell` setting is enabled, keystrokes are intercepted and checked:

1. **Explicit skip list**: Keystrokes in `keybindings_to_skip_shell` setting are always handled by Bspterm
2. **Terminal-context bindings**: Only keybindings with `"context": "Terminal"` predicate are intercepted
3. **Global bindings**: Keybindings without a Terminal context predicate are sent to the shell

### Key Functions

- `should_skip_shell()`: Main decision function combining all checks
- `keystroke_has_bspterm_action_binding()`: Checks if keystroke has a Terminal-context keybinding
- `predicate_contains_terminal()`: Recursively checks if a `KeyBindingContextPredicate` contains "Terminal"

### Examples

| Keystroke | Action | Context | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `ctrl-p` | `menu::SelectPrevious` | Global | Sent to shell |
| `ctrl-v` | `terminal::Paste` | Terminal | Intercepted by Bspterm |
| `ctrl-c` | `terminal::SendKeystroke` | Terminal | Sent to shell (explicitly forwarded) |
| `ctrl-shift-c` | `terminal::Copy` | Terminal | Intercepted by Bspterm |

### Special Actions

- `terminal::SendKeystroke` and `terminal::SendText` are always sent to the shell, even with Terminal context

### Terminal Search

Search functionality is available in the terminal via:
- **Context menu**: Right-click → "Find" (uses `buffer_search::Deploy::find()`)
- **Toolbar button**: Search icon (magnifying glass) in terminal panel tab bar

## Terminal Gutter

The terminal gutter displays line numbers, timestamps, and separator lines in the left margin (`crates/terminal_view/src/terminal_element.rs`, `crates/terminal_view/src/row_decorator.rs`).

### Display Logic

Both line numbers and timestamps only appear on lines that have actual content (terminal output). This is determined by checking `terminal.get_line_timestamp(grid_line)`:

| Feature | Condition | Behavior |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Line numbers | `get_line_timestamp().is_some()` | Only on lines with output |
| Timestamps | `get_line_timestamp().is_some()` | Only on lines with output |
| Empty lines | No timestamp | No gutter content displayed |
| Gap separators | Timestamp gap >10s | Horizontal line between rows |

### Row Decorator System

The gutter supports pluggable decorations via the `RowDecorator` trait (`row_decorator.rs`):

```rust
pub trait RowDecorator: Send + Sync {
    fn layout(&mut self, row_index: usize, grid_line: i32, terminal: &Terminal) -> Vec<RowDecoration>;
    fn reset(&mut self);
}
```

**Built-in Decorators:**
- `TimestampGapDecorator`: Draws horizontal separator lines between output lines when the timestamp gap exceeds 10 seconds

**Adding New Decorators:**
1. Implement `RowDecorator` trait
2. Add to painters vec in `TerminalElement::prepaint()`
3. Decorations are collected in `layout_gutter()` and painted in `paint_gutter()`

### Key Functions

- `layout_gutter()`: Calculates gutter dimensions, creates `GutterLineEntry` for each visible row, and collects decorations from painters
- `paint_gutter()`: Renders decorations, line numbers, and timestamps based on `GutterLineEntry` data
- `get_line_timestamp()`: Returns `Option<DateTime>` indicating if a line has content

### Settings

- `gutter.line_numbers`: Enable/disable line numbers
- `gutter.timestamps`: Enable/disable timestamps
- `gutter.relative_line_numbers`: Show relative line numbers in vi mode
- `gutter.timestamp_format`: Format string for timestamp display

## Remote Explorer Panel

The `remote_explorer` crate (`crates/remote_explorer`) provides a panel for browsing saved SSH/Telnet sessions in a tree view.

### Architecture

- Uses `UniformList` for virtual scrolling with flattened tree structure
- Indentation via `ListItem.indent_level()` with `px(12.)` step size
- Icons: `FolderOpen`/`Folder` for groups, `Server` for sessions
- Subscribes to `SessionStoreEvent` for automatic updates

### Key Components

- `FlattenedEntry`: Flattened tree entry with `id`, `depth`, and `node`
- `RemoteExplorer`: Main panel struct implementing `Panel`, `Focusable`, `Render`
- `init(cx)`: Initializes `SessionStoreEntity` and registers `ToggleFocus` action
- `load()`: Async loader for workspace panel initialization

### Integration Points

- **Action**: `bspterm_actions::remote_explorer::ToggleFocus`
- **Menu**: View > Remote Explorer
- **Icon**: Server icon in left dock
- **Position**: Left or Right dock (default: Left)
- **Priority**: `activation_priority = 10`


### Quick Add Area (`crates/remote_explorer/src/quick_add/`)

Auto-recognize input supports flexible IP detection anywhere in the string with smart credential detection:

| Format | Example | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| IP only | `192.168.1.1` | Telnet:23, grouped by IP |
| IP:port | `192.168.1.1:22` | SSH:22, grouped by IP |
| With credentials | `192.168.1.1 root pass` | Telnet with auth |
| Smart credentials | `192.168.1.1 root123 Root@123` | user=root123, pass=Root@123 |
| With label | `192.168.1.1 root Root@123 slot23` | Name includes "slot23" |
| Name prefix | `管理网口192.168.1.1 huawei Admin@123` | Name=管理网口, with auth |
| Multi-line | `6.6.62.23 slot23\nhuawei\nRouter@202508` | Single connection with credentials |
| Bulk (环境/后台) | `环境192.168.1.1\troot\tpass` | Telnet, grouped by IP |

**Session Grouping:** All quick-add sessions are automatically placed in a group named after the IP address.

**Smart Token Classification:**
- **Username**: Common names (root, admin, huawei, cisco) or names starting with them (root123)
- **Password**: Contains special characters (@!#$%) or has complexity (mixed case + digits)
- **Label**: Contains non-ASCII (中文) or alphanumeric mix (slot23)
- **Port**: Pure digits 1-65535

**Multi-line Format:** If input has multiple lines but only the first contains an IP, subsequent lines are parsed as credentials.

**Credential separators:** tab, slash, or space. **Bulk import:** `环境` = Telnet, `后台` = SSH.

## Terminal Reconnection

The terminal supports reconnecting to SSH/Telnet sessions while preserving scrollback history (`crates/terminal/src/terminal.rs`, `crates/terminal_view/src/terminal_view.rs`).

### Architecture

When reconnecting, the existing `Terminal` entity is reused rather than creating a new one:
- The `Term` object (which holds the scrollback buffer) is never replaced
- A new connection is created using the stored `events_tx` sender
- The new connection sends events through the same channel to the existing `Term`

### Key Components

- `events_tx: UnboundedSender<AlacTermEvent>`: Stored in Terminal struct for reuse during reconnection
- `Terminal::reconnect(&self, cx: &App) -> Task<Result<Box<dyn TerminalConnection>>>`: Creates new SSH/Telnet connection using existing `events_tx` and current terminal size
- `Terminal::set_connection(&mut self, connection: Box<dyn TerminalConnection>)`: Updates terminal to use new connection
- `TerminalView::reconnect_terminal()`: Orchestrates reconnection, prints status messages

### Reconnection Flow

1. User triggers reconnect → "Connecting..." printed
2. `terminal.reconnect(cx)` creates new connection with existing `events_tx`
3. On success: `terminal.set_connection(connection)` updates terminal
4. Scrollback history remains intact throughout

## Editor Panel

The `editor_panel` crate (`crates/editor_panel`) provides a dockable panel for code editing, similar to the main editor but positioned in a dock.

### Architecture

- Wraps a `Pane` containing editor items
- Auto-closes when the last tab is closed (matches TerminalPanel behavior)
- Supports tab bar display and pane splitting

### Key Components

- `EditorPanel`: Main panel struct implementing `Panel`, `Focusable`, `Render`
- `new_editor_pane()`: Creates a configured pane for the editor panel
- `init(cx)`: Registers `ToggleFocus` action

### Integration Points

- **Action**: `editor_panel::ToggleFocus`
- **Position**: Left, Right, or Bottom dock (default: Right)
- **Auto-close**: Panel closes automatically when last tab is closed

## Terminal Python Scripting

Python scripts automate terminal sessions via Unix socket JSON-RPC (`crates/terminal_scripting/`, `crates/script_panel/`).

### JSON-RPC Methods

`session.current`, `session.list`, `session.create_ssh`, `session.create_telnet`, `terminal.send`, `terminal.read`, `terminal.wait_for`, `terminal.run`, `terminal.close`

### Python Client (`assets/scripts/bspterm.py`)

```python
from bspterm import current_terminal, SSH, Telnet

# Focused terminal
term = current_terminal()
output = term.run("ls -la")

# Background SSH
term = SSH.connect("192.168.1.1", user="root", password="secret")
term.wait_for("$")
term.run("hostname")
term.close()
```

### Script Panel

- **Action**: `bspterm_actions::script_panel::ToggleFocus`
- **Scripts**: `~/.config/bspterm/scripts/*.py`
- **Env vars**: `BSPTERM_SOCKET`, `BSPTERM_CURRENT_TERMINAL`

## Terminal Automation Rules

Rule-based automation for auto-login (`crates/terminal/src/rule_store.rs`, `crates/terminal/src/rule_engine.rs`, `crates/rule_editor/`).

### Data Structures

- `AutomationRule`: id, name, enabled, trigger, max_triggers, condition, action
- `TriggerEvent`: Wakeup (output received), Connected, Disconnected
- `RuleCondition`: Pattern, ConnectionType, All (AND), Any (OR)
- `RuleAction`: SendText, SendCredential, RunPython, Sequence, Delay

### RuleEngine

```rust
let engine = RuleEngine::new(&connection_info, &rules);
let actions = engine.check(TriggerEvent::Wakeup, &screen_content);
```

**Features:** Pre-compiled regex, 2s cooldown, `max_triggers` limit per connection.

### Terminal Integration

- `init_rule_engine()`: Called on connection established
- `check_rules(trigger, cx)`: Called on Wakeup and connection state changes

### Rule Editor Panel

- **Action**: `bspterm_actions::rule_editor::ToggleFocus`
- **Position**: Right dock

**Persistence:** `~/.config/bspterm/terminal_rules.json`
**Defaults:** `assets/settings/default_terminal_rules.json`

**Test:** `cargo test -p terminal rule_engine`

## Terminal Abbreviations

Command abbreviation system for quick input expansion (`crates/terminal/src/abbr_store.rs`, `crates/terminal_view/src/abbr_bar.rs`).

### Data Structures

- `AbbreviationProtocol`: Protocol filter enum (`All`, `Ssh`, `Telnet`)
- `Abbreviation`: Trigger word, expansion text, enabled flag, and protocol filter
- `AbbreviationStore`: Collection of abbreviations with global settings
- `AbbreviationStoreEntity`: GPUI entity with auto-save and event emission

### Protocol Filtering

Abbreviations can be scoped to specific connection types:

| Protocol | Matches |
|----------|---------|
| `All` | All terminals (local, SSH, Telnet) |
| `Ssh` | SSH connections only |
| `Telnet` | Telnet connections only |

```rust
let protocol = terminal.get_current_protocol(); // Some(Ssh), Some(Telnet), or None
let abbr = store.find_by_trigger("g", protocol.as_ref());
let visible = store.abbreviations_for_protocol(protocol.as_ref());
```

### Expansion Behavior

1. User types trigger word followed by space or Enter
2. Terminal checks if word is at command position (first word or after `|`, `&&`, etc.)
3. Abbreviation lookup filters by current terminal's protocol
4. If matched: trigger is replaced with expansion text

### UI Components

- **Abbr Bar**: Shows protocol-filtered abbreviations for current terminal
- **Add Modal**: Protocol selector defaults to current terminal's connection type
- **Edit Modal**: Allows changing abbreviation's protocol
- **Config Modal**: Lists all abbreviations with protocol labels

**Persistence:** `~/.config/bspterm/abbreviations.json`

## Terminal Semantic Highlighting

Regex-based semantic highlighting for terminal output (`crates/terminal/src/highlight_rule.rs`, `crates/terminal/src/highlight_store.rs`, `crates/terminal/src/terminal_lsp.rs`).

### Data Structures

- `TerminalTokenType`: Semantic token types (Error, Warning, Info, Debug, Timestamp, IpAddress, Url, Path, Number, Success, Custom)
- `TerminalTokenModifiers`: Bitfield for styles (Bold, Italic, Underline, Dim, Strikethrough)
- `HighlightProtocol`: Protocol filter enum (`All`, `Ssh`, `Telnet`, `Local`)
- `HighlightRule`: Rule definition with pattern, token type, modifiers, priority, colors, protocol filter
- `SemanticToken`: Highlighted region with position (line, start_col, length) and styling

### HighlightStore

- `HighlightStore`: Rule collection with version, enabled flag, CRUD operations
- `HighlightStoreEntity`: GPUI entity with auto-save and event emission
- `HighlightStoreEvent`: Events (Changed, RuleAdded, RuleRemoved, HighlightingToggled)

**Usage:** `HighlightStoreEntity::init(cx)` on startup, then `HighlightStoreEntity::global(cx)` to access.

### TerminalLanguageServer

Pattern matching engine in `terminal_lsp.rs`:
- `CompiledRule`: Pre-compiled regex with case-insensitivity support
- `compute_line_tokens()`: Match rules against line, return `Vec<SemanticToken>`
- Priority-based evaluation (higher priority first, no overlapping tokens)
- Protocol filtering for connection-specific rules

### Default Rules

| Rule | Priority | Pattern Example |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Error keywords | 100 | `\b(error|fail(ed)?|fatal|critical)\b` |
| Warning keywords | 90 | `\b(warn(ing)?|caution|deprecated)\b` |
| Success keywords | 85 | `\b(success(ful)?|passed|ok|done)\b` |
| IPv4 Address | 60 | `\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b` |
| URL | 55 | `https?://[^\s<>"']+` |
| ISO Timestamp | 50 | `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}[T ]\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}` |
| Unix Path | 40 | `(?:/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)+` |

### Default Colors

| Token Type | Color |
|------------|-------|
| Error | `#e06c75` (red) |
| Warning | `#e5c07b` (yellow) |
| Success | `#98c379` (green) |

### Rendering Integration

In `terminal_element.rs`:
1. `compute_semantic_tokens()`: Extract text from cells, create LSP server, compute tokens
2. During cell rendering, lookup matching token at position
3. Apply token's foreground color and modifiers (bold, italic, underline)

**Persistence:** `~/.config/bspterm/highlight_rules.json`
**Defaults:** `assets/settings/default_highlight_rules.json`

## Agent Connection Fallback

The `agent_servers` crate (`crates/agent_servers/`) provides fallback mechanisms when the ACP (Agent Client Protocol) fails to connect.

### Module Structure

```
src/
├── agent_servers.rs    # Main module, exports, AgentServer trait
├── acp.rs              # ACP protocol implementation, connect_with_fallback
├── claude.rs           # Claude Code agent server
├── terminal_mode.rs    # Terminal fallback connection
├── prompt_mode.rs      # --prompt flag fallback connection
├── codex.rs            # Codex agent server
├── gemini.rs           # Gemini agent server
└── custom.rs           # Custom agent servers
```

### Connection Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` (default) | Tries ACP first, falls back to Terminal mode on failure |
| `acp` | Use ACP JSON-RPC over stdio (standard protocol) |
| `terminal` | Run agent in a terminal, interact via text input |
| `prompt` | Spawn new process with `--prompt` flag for each message |

### Key Types

- `ConnectionMode`: Enum defining connection strategies (`Auto`, `Acp`, `Terminal`, `Prompt`)
- `TerminalModeConnection`: Runs agent in a terminal and sends text
- `PromptModeConnection`: Spawns subprocess with `--prompt` for each message
- `AcpConnectionError`: Detailed error types for ACP failures

### connect_with_fallback (`acp.rs`)

```rust
pub async fn connect_with_fallback(
    server_name: SharedString,
    command: AgentServerCommand,
    root_dir: &Path,
    default_mode: Option<SessionModeId>,
    default_model: Option<ModelId>,
    default_config_options: HashMap<String, String>,
    is_remote: bool,
    connection_mode: ConnectionMode,
    cx: &mut AsyncApp,
) -> Result<Rc<dyn AgentConnection>>
```

**Behavior:**
- `Auto`: Tries ACP → on failure logs warning and falls back to Terminal
- `Acp`/`Terminal`/`Prompt`: Uses specified mode directly

### Settings Configuration

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "claude": {
      "connection_mode": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

**File:** `crates/settings_content/src/agent.rs` defines `ConnectionMode` enum and `BuiltinAgentServerSettings.connection_mode` field.

### When to Use Fallback Modes

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Agent supports ACP | `auto` or `acp` |
| Agent outputs non-JSON to stdout | `terminal` |
| Agent has hooks that pollute stdout | `terminal` |
| Agent only supports `--prompt` flag | `prompt` |
| Each request should be isolated | `prompt` |

### Logging

When ACP fails, detailed logs help diagnose the issue:

```
[INFO] Connecting to agent 'codeagent' with auto mode (trying ACP first)...
[WARN] ACP connection failed for 'codeagent': expected JSON-RPC response...
[INFO] Attempting Terminal mode fallback for 'codeagent'...
[INFO] Terminal mode connection established for 'codeagent'
```

## Base Keymap Configuration

The base keymap setting has been simplified to only support two options (`crates/settings/src/base_keymap_setting.rs`):

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `VSCode` (default) | VS Code-style keybindings |
| `None` | No base keymap, only user-defined bindings |

Other editor keymaps (JetBrains, Sublime Text, Atom, Emacs, Cursor, TextMate) have been removed.

**Keymap Files Kept:**
- `assets/keymaps/default-linux.json`
- `assets/keymaps/default-macos.json`
- `assets/keymaps/default-windows.json`
- `assets/keymaps/vim.json`
- `assets/keymaps/initial.json`
- `assets/keymaps/storybook.json`

## Zed 遗留命名

以下模块/文件保留了 Zed 命名，这是历史原因造成的：

| 路径 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| `crates/client/src/zed_urls.rs` | URL 处理模块 |
| `crates/zlog/` | 日志 crate（zlog 不是 zed_log） |
| `crates/install_cli/src/register_zed_scheme.rs` | URL scheme 注册 |
| `crates/docs_preprocessor/` | 文档预处理器 |

这些不需要重命名，但在代码中应注意区分。
